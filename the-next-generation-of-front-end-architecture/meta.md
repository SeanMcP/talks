**Title:**

- The next generation of front-end architecture
- There are back again
- Back to the future
- Whatâ€™s old is new
- Nothing new under the sun

**Subtitle:**

**Presentation details:**

In recent years, we have seen a significant shift in front-end architecture from
client-side rendering and single-page applications (CSR/SPAs) to server-side
rendering and multi-page applications (SSR/MPAs). In this talk we will analyze
this trend in its historical context, explore specific examples in the React
ecosystem, and discuss its implications for building robust front-end
applications.

**Please tell us about your topic of interest/presentation:**

This presentation will be slides-driven, and will include some code and
technical information. A rough outline:

- Introduction
- Thesis
- A brief history of serving websites
- Rise of SPAs
- Return to MPAs
- Examples
- Recommendations
- Conclusion
- Q&A

---

Architectures:
- Static sites
- Server-rendered sites
- Single-page applications
- Multi-page applications
- Islands?

Patterns:
- SSG
- SSR
- CSR
- CSN
- Hybrid routing
- Hybrid rendering
- Islands?
- Plugins?

> Explore different front-end architecture in a roughly chronological order

> Build our library of architectures and patterns as we go

Outline
- Arch: static sites
- Arch: server-rendered sites
    - Pattern: server-side rendering
    - (Maybe) Pattern: plugins
    - Example: Wordpress
- Arch: single-page applications
    - Pattern: client-side rendering
    - Pattern: client-side navigation
    - Example: `create-react-app` with `react-router-dom`
- Arch: static sites (revisted)
    - Pattern: static-site generation
    - Pattern: islands
    - Example: Gatsby and Astro (other: Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy)
- Arch: multi-page applications
    - Pattern: server-side rendering *with* client-side hydration
    - Pattern: hybrid rendering
    - Pattern: hybrid routing
    - Pattern: islands [x]
    - Example: Next and Remix (other: SvelteKit, Nuxt)
