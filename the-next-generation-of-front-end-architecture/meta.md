**Presentation details:**

In recent years, we have seen a significant shift in front-end architecture from
client-side rendering and single-page applications (CSR/SPAs) to server-side
rendering and multi-page applications (SSR/MPAs). In this talk we will analyze
this trend in its historical context, explore specific examples in the React
ecosystem, and discuss its implications for building robust front-end
applications.

This presentation will be slides-driven, and will include some code and
technical information. A rough outline:
